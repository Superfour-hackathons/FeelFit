# FeelFit

This is an e-commerce website for fitness products made by a team of four for the 2021 CUNY hackathon

## How we built it
We built it using HTML, CSS and javascript. It's hosted using GitHub Pages, you can view it here: [Link to Github Pages](https://superfour-hackathons.github.io/FeelFit/)

## Challenges we ran into
One of our biggest challenges was the 24-hour timeframe we had to get things ready. There were a lot of ideas tossed around, but due to time constraints, they had to be filed away for a later date.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
I'm glad that we were able to successfully deploy a working webpage. At one point in time, we weren't sure if we could bring things together. But I'm really glad we were able to pull through!

## What's next for StayFit
- OAuth using other platforms (LinkedIn, Facebook, etc)
- Secure login using PHP
- Have a contact page that sends an email directly to an official email
- Use Amazon affiliate links targeting specific products
- A checkout page with a Paypal integration
